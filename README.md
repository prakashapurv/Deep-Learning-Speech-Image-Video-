ASR +  Image and Video Categorization using Deep Belief Neural Network

To study and analyze deep belief neural network for speech and video processing:

­Image categorization + Video content categorization and video frame search using Deep Belief Neural Networks( JAN

2013­ MAY 2013) ­

In this project,I worked in the field of object recognition and its application in the

field of video content categorization using deep belief network. Due to computational complexities

in using video based features we used image based features for analyzing video frame information

and categorizing into 10 predefined object. The first two layers of the deep network was trained in

an unsupervised greedy manner using Contrastive divergence algorithm on a data set of 50,000

tiny images from CIFAR­10 data set. Supervised gradient descent of the negative log­likelihood

cost function was performed on the final layer to fine tune the data. Frames of the videos from

Youtube were then classified by passing them in the trained network. Finally overall video was

categorized into predefine classes depending on the quantity of the frames classified.



­ Classification of speech occurrences into different phoneme classes using Deep Belief Neural

Networks (JULY 2012 – DEC 2012) ­

In this module, I worked in the field of Automatic Speech recognition where I classified speech

occurrences into different phoneme classes using deep belief neural network. In this project 13­

order MFCC was used as a feature vector to train the network using greedy layer wise contrastive

divergence procedure. RBM was tweaked into GBRBM (Gaussian Bernoulli RBM) in order to

model real valued MFCC data. Fine­tuning was performed using the labeled training data set from

TIMIT corpus for optimizing the classification task.
